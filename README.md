Projects done in masters
1 - Code Analyzer - The analyzer, given a set of file references, finds all the types, their members, and relationships with other types. Further, the analyzer constructs two metrics for each member function its size in lines of code, and complexity defined as the number of elements in its scope tree. Technlogy: C#.NET
2 - XML Document Model - This provides an XML parsing facility that reads XML strings or text files, builds a Document object that can be queried for information about the XML contents, supports programmatic modification of the Document, and can write the revisions to another XML string or file. It provides C++ packages to: parse the input, build a tree-based in-memory representation of the XML called a parse tree1, and support modifications of that representation. This facility will support read and write operations. It will also support the programmatic creation of new XML strings and files. Technology: C++
3 - Remote Code Management - This project provides a facility for remote code management (RCM). Management consists of transferring files to and from the local and remote machines, exploring a directory subtree on a remote machine, identifying files and searching for specific texts within files. The facility will use communication softwaret o start search tasks on a remote server and return results while serving multiple concurrent clients. Technology: C++
