#Projects done in masters
1. Code Analyzer - The analyzer, given a set of file references, finds all the types, their members, 
                   and relationships with other types. Further, the analyzer constructs two metrics for each member function
                   its size in lines of code, and complexity defined as the number of elements in its scope tree.
                   Technlogy: C#.NET
2. XML Document Model - This provides an XML parsing facility that reads XML strings or text files, builds a Document object 
                        that can be queried for information about the XML contents, supports programmatic modification of the
                        Document, and can write the revisions to another XML string or file. 
                        It provides C++ packages to: parse the input, build a tree-based in-memory representation of the XML 
                        called a parse tree1, and support modifications of that representation. 
                        This facility will support read and write operations. It will also support the programmatic creation 
                        of new XML strings and files.
                        Technology: C++
3. Remote Code Management - This project provides a facility for remote code management (RCM). 
                            Management consists of transferring files to and from the local and remote machines, 
                            exploring a directory subtree on a remote machine, identifying files and searching for 
                            specific texts within files. The facility will use communication softwaret o start search 
                            tasks on a remote server and return results while serving multiple concurrent clients.
                            Technology: C++
4. Tourister - Tourister provides you ability to view your nearest attrcations and view tours. You can also view pictures of the place                  and share them with your friends. Mark places as favorites and the view them later. Select places from a wide variety of                  categories ranging from Architecture , Food etc.
5. Hadoop Project - In cloud computing, idle resources can be allocated to the users in the form of service. To allocate these resources                     from the Cloud Resource Providers (CRP) to Cloud Resource Consumers (CRC) we need a reliable algorithm to reduce the                     overall allocation cost of resources among the whole system where CRP’s and CRC’s are satisfied. As to achieve this                      situation we applied Vogel’s Approximation Algorithm, which is an evolutionary model to reduce the overall cost of                       the system.
